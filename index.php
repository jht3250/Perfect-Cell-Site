        <p>The CRAP design principles are a set of rules for web design, guiding web developers to create websites that are pleasant to look at, while also offering a large blanket of accessibility to users, allowing for more people to use the website. The main aspects building the acronym are:</p>
        <p>Contrast, Repetition, Alignment and Proximity.</p>
        <p>Team Perfect Cell aims to teach users of the site about CRAP design principles, by showing them direct bad examples of design, then with user interaction (likely a button or arrow press) they can change aspects of the site to better adhere to the CRAP design rules. All interactivity and the intention with the areas where purposefully bad design will be outlined clearly for the user before the examples are given. We expect that the interactivity of the site will make learning the principles of design more memorable, opposed to just scrolling down.</p>
